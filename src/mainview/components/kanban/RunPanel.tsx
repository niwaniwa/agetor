  //      dispatch any scroll event of its own. This is the cheap backstop:
  //      it only fires on the dependencies listed below, so it covers
  //      commits that change content without changing either box the
  //      ResizeObserver watches, and it also recovers any pin that path 2
  //      skipped under the suppression window (see below) once the next
  //      real growth or a dependency change comes through. Running
  //      pre-paint (not as a passive effect) matters most on a violent
  //      commit — e.g. the live→rebuilt `displayedEvents` swap, where every
  //      event's key changes and the whole transcript remounts. The two
  //      changes here are jointly, not independently, sufficient:
  //      `[overflow-anchor:none]` (see the container's className comment)
  //      removes native anchoring as a competing `scrollTop` writer — left
  //      enabled, it runs during layout, which happens AFTER layout
  //      effects, so even with the pin converted to `useLayoutEffect` an
  //      anchoring-driven jump would still land after the pin and override
  //      it. The layout-effect conversion, in turn, closes the remaining
  //      window where a same-frame scroll event could latch `nearBottomRef`
  //      false before the pin gets a chance to read it. With both in place,
  //      the pin runs while `nearBottomRef` still holds its pre-commit
  //      value, and no post-effect scroll adjustment is left that could
  //      latch it false first.
  //   2. A ResizeObserver on both the scroll container (`logRef`) and the
  //      content wrapper (`logContentRef`) below. The container's own box
  //      shrinks when something mounts above it in the flex column —
  //      `SubagentTabs` or a terminal tab strip resolving from an async
  //      list fetch — which otherwise leaves the log short with no event to
  //      hook. The content wrapper's height grows asynchronously for
  //      reasons invisible to path 1's dependency list: replay-buffer
  //      flushes landing on their own timer, markdown/code block layout
  //      settling after mount, and a `UserMessageBlock`'s "Show more"
  //      toggle appearing once it measures itself. Observing both, rather
  //      than enumerating every async cause as a dependency, makes the pin
  //      self-healing against future async widgets. Both paths now run
  //      pre-paint (path 1 as a layout effect, this one via ResizeObserver's
  //      own pre-paint delivery in the same rendering opportunity as the
  //      resize), so neither is "ahead" of the other in the sense that used
  //      to matter; ResizeObserver still earns its keep as a separate path
  //      because it fires on box-size changes path 1's dependency list
  //      can't see (see above). Assigning `scrollTop` does not change
  //      either observed element's size, so the pin can't feed back into
  //      its own observer; the resulting scroll event just re-confirms
  //      `nearBottomRef` as true. Mount-scoped (`[]`) is correct —
  //      `RunPanelBody` doesn't remount on task switch, so both refs stay
  //      attached to the same DOM nodes across tasks and a fresh
  //      `observe()` isn't needed per task.
  //
  //      Two additional guards keep path 2 from hijacking a user-initiated
  //      resize (e.g. expanding/collapsing a "Show more" toggle while
  //      parked near the bottom):
  //        - `pinSuppressUntilRef`, armed for a short window by any
  //          pointerdown inside the log (see `onPointerDownCapture` below),
  //          skips the pin entirely so it doesn't fight a deliberate toggle
  //          or the `pendingAdjustRef` scroll compensation in
  //          `UserMessageBlock`.
  //        - `prevDist`, the distance-from-bottom computed from box sizes
  //          tracked across deliveries, re-checks bottom-proximity against
  //          the pre-resize layout rather than trusting `nearBottomRef`
  //          alone — that ref is latched by scroll events, which WebKit can
  //          throttle during momentum scrolling, so it can still read stale
  //          `true` mid-fling. `el.scrollTop` read synchronously is always
  //          current even when scroll events lag, so the pre-resize

   *  recovery sentinel isn't `state: "active"` — `paused` gets the notice
   *  below instead, and `recovered`/`cleared` have nothing left to show here
   *  (the persisted summary line for those transitions lives in the
   *  transcript itself, written once by the driver, not derived on every

   *  new run before it starts making progress of its own, so a naive read
   *  would flash a stale "attempt 10/10" (or worse, a stale `paused`) as if
   *  it were live. `payload.replayed` is fx-acp.ts's own stamp, present only
   *  while replay is in flight, never on a genuinely live sentinel — so this
   *  memo simply reads as `null` (no live notice) until real progress on the

   *  as long as fx's own `requiredAction` says so (`isFxRecoveryResumable`).
   *  `latestRun.status === "failed"` alone is enough to know no newer run is

   *  every other archived-gated action in this panel), or once the latest
   *  sentinel for that run no longer reads as resumable (e.g. a later

   *  "…resume once the limit clears, or send a new message." line the driver
   *  already persisted into the transcript at the pause transition — this is
   *  purely a live, disappearing-once-acted-on affordance layered on top,

   *  `latestRun.status === "failed"` alone is stale for up to the 2s runs-
   *  poll interval after a new turn actually starts (Resume itself, or an

   *  refreshes on that poll, so for that window `latestRun` can still be the
   *  OLD failed run with its (still-resumable) payload even though a new run
   *  is already `running` server-side — the button would stay clickable and
   *  a second click could race the in-flight turn. `task.column !== "running"`
   *  closes that window: the `column` field flips to `"running"` promptly via
   *  the column SSE event (independent of the runs poll), so it's the
   *  faster-arriving of the two signals here. The `resumeBusy`/
   *  `resumeClickedRunIdRef` bookkeeping above is the complementary backstop
   *  for a Resume click specifically (busy stays true until `latestRun.id`
   *  itself has moved on) — this column check additionally covers an
   *  ordinary new message reopening the same window.
   *
   *  Deliberately does NOT gate on `payload.replayed` the way
   *  `liveRecoveryNotice` above does: a `paused` sentinel replayed onto a
   *  resume run that itself died before making progress (e.g. the resume
   *  turn's own connection dropped) is still an accurate description of
   *  fx's checkpoint — fx never cleared it, so Resume must stay offered.
   *  `liveRecoveryNotice` hides replayed sentinels because it renders
   *  in-progress retry noise that goes stale the moment real progress
   *  resumes; `pausedRecovery` renders a terminal state that stays true
   *  until something explicit changes it (a `cleared` sentinel, or a
   *  genuinely new run). */

          the previous task's open/closed state and sockets. Keying forces a
          fresh mount per task, which both re-seeds the open/closed toggle
          from the new task's `openTerminalCount` and, via `TerminalView`'s
          own unmount, closes the previous task's terminal sockets instead of
          leaking them across the switch.

          The key is NAMESPACED (`terminals-…`), never a bare `task.id`:
          `BacklogTray` below is a sibling in this same children list and is
          keyed per task too. Sibling keys share one namespace, and React's
          keyed reconciliation keeps a single old fiber per key — with two
          `key={task.id}` siblings the tray's fiber shadowed this one, so
          every re-render on the reconciler's map-based slow path while the
          tray was mounted — in practice all of them, since the normally
          `false` `{searchOpen && …}` child above breaks the fast path —
          mounted a NEW section and never deleted the old one (a growing
          stack of TERMINAL rows, each holding a live `TerminalView`). The
          rule for this fragment: every keyed child carries its component's
          name in the key (`PlanDialog` below is the third one). See
