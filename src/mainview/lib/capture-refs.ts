/**
 * Handle drag/drop *and* clipboard paste.
 *
 * WKWebView exposes no reliable way to recover a dropped/pasted item's real
 * path or bytes up front, so items are resolved through a recovery ladder,
 * each rung falling through to the next when it comes up empty:
 *
 *   1. `file://` URLs (`extractFilePaths`, both drop and paste). Finder
 *      drags/pastes carry the file's real path this way. When any
 *      non-transient ones are present we resolve those to references on the
 *      server (which stats each for directory-ness + existence) and use
 *      *only* those — a dragged image file also shows up as an image blob,
 *      but we want its on-disk path, not a copy. Transient temp-dir URLs
 *      (screenshot thumbnails) are excluded so they fall through to rung 3.
 *
 *   2. The macOS drag pasteboard (`opts.dragRefs`), **drop only**. WKWebView
 *      exposes no `file://` URLs on an ordinary Finder drop (rung 1 above
 *      returns `[]` in practice for anything but a paste), so this is the
 *      real recovery path for non-image files and folders dragged from
 *      Finder: the server reads the drag pasteboard the drop just ended and
 *      stats each path. **Never consulted on paste** — the clipboard has no
 *      concept of "the drag that just happened"; the drag pasteboard could
 *      hold an unrelated *earlier* drag's paths (or be stale/empty), and
 *      querying it on paste would attach the wrong files. Non-transient,
 *      screenshot-uploadable-image refs are dropped (they stay on the rung 3
 *      upload path below, unchanged); everything else is partitioned into
 *      directory refs and file refs:
 *        - Directory refs are **always accepted** — they're part of the
 *          drag that just ended, and WebKit often produces no `File` entry
 *          for a directory at all, so basename-matching one against
 *          `collected` (the way file refs are validated below) would be
 *          unreliable.
 *        - File refs are only trusted **when `collected` is non-empty**, and
 *          only the ones whose basename matches a collected `File` (guards a
 *          stale pasteboard). When `collected` is empty, no file refs are
 *          accepted — a folder-only drop legitimately collects zero `File`s
 *          in WebKit (covered by the directory-refs rule above), but trusting
 *          bare file refs with nothing to cross-check against would let a
 *          stale/unrelated earlier drag's pasteboard attach files that were
 *          never part of this drop. This means a "notes.txt + myproj/
 *          dropped together" drop attaches *both* — the directory
 *          unconditionally, the file because it matches a collected `File`.
 *      Any collected `File` whose basename matches an accepted ref (folder or
 *      file) is consumed here and skips rung 3/4 below.
 *
 *   3. Each remaining carried file is classified, in order:
 *      - `file.path` present (future-proofing; always undefined in
 *        WKWebView) → use it directly.
 *      - `isDirectory` (set by `collectFiles` from `webkitGetAsEntry()`) →
 *        can't be uploaded or byte-copied as a single blob, so it's counted
 *        in `skippedFolders` and dropped (rung 4).
 *      - `image/*` blob (macOS floating screenshot thumbnail, Cmd+V image
 *        paste, or an image left over after rung 2) → upload via the
 *        injected `uploader` and use the path the server writes.
 *      - `f.size === 0 && !f.type` → a probable directory that arrived via
 *        `source.files` (which never carries `isDirectory`, see
 *        `collectFiles`) or via a `webkitGetAsEntry()` that returned null —
 *        WebKit surfaces a dropped folder as a zero-byte, typeless `File` in
 *        both cases, indistinguishable from a genuinely empty file except by
 *        this heuristic. Counted in `skippedFolders` rather than uploaded, to
 *        avoid POSTing a directory Blob whose read would fail on the server.
 *        (Trade-off: a real empty, typeless file also loses its byte-copy
 *        fallback here — accepted, since its pasteboard path usually
 *        recovers it via rung 1 or 2 first.)
 *      - any other blob → byte-copy fallback: upload via the injected
 *        `attachmentUploader` and use the path the server writes. This is
 *        what lets a path-less non-image paste (or a drop whose pasteboard
 *        lookup failed) still attach instead of being skipped.
 *
 *   4. See the `isDirectory` and zero-byte-blob branches in rung 3 above —
 *      both funnel into `skippedFolders`. There is no other "uncategorizable"
 *      case: every collected file is either a ref, an upload, or a folder.
 *
 * Everything read directly off the DataTransfer (`collectFiles`,
 * `extractFilePaths`) happens synchronously before the first `await`, since
 * the object is invalidated once the event handler yields; the pasteboard
 * lookup and any uploads happen after, on the already-collected data.
 *
 * `uploader` / `resolver` / `dragRefs` / `attachmentUploader` are
 * parameterised for testability — production callers omit them and pick up
 * the real `api.*`. A `dragRefs` failure (network error, no active drag on
 * the server side, etc.) is swallowed and treated as "nothing recovered" —
 * it must degrade to the pre-existing behavior, not surface as a hard error.
