 * Fable follows the same current-release convention as Opus: `fable-5.1`
 * owns the "Fable" row since the installed claude CLI (2.1.257) ships the
 * `claude-fable-5-1` model id, so the now-superseded `fable-5` maps to `null`
 * (next-run-only, same as any other superseded pinned id). Opus follows the

 * ships `claude-opus-5-5` as its default Opus model (CHANGELOG "now the
 * default Opus model"; the binary's alias table maps `opus` →
 * `claude-opus-5-5` and the picker rows read "Opus 5.5 - best for everyday,
 * complex tasks" / "Opus 5 - previous Opus version"), so `opus-5` joins
 * `opus-4.8`, `opus-4.7`, `opus-4.6`, `sonnet-4.6` and `fable-5` in the null

 * Sonnet model on the Anthropic API"; the binary's alias table maps `sonnet` →
 * `claude-sonnet-5-5` and the picker's previous-version row reads "Sonnet 5 -
 * previous Sonnet version"), so `sonnet-5` joins the null (next-run-only)
 * bucket too. `mythos-5` and `mythos-5.1` both have no picker row
 * at all — claude's picker has no Mythos row of any kind. An unknown/future

    //      the card's `/files/preview` image tile and its stat-driven file

    //      delivered" card with an image tile (PNG) and a generic file tile
    //      (Markdown), which is also what bumps `tasks.sent_files` / the
    //      board's paperclip badge to a count of 2.
    //   2. A second, ERRORED `SendUserFile` call pointed at the
    //      `agetor-sent` DIRECTORY itself — mirrors the real, live-probed
    //      claude behavior of rejecting a directory with
    //      `<tool_use_error>Attachment "<path>" is not a regular file.
    //      </tool_use_error>` (see `src/shared/sent-files.ts`'s header
    //      comment) — the error card, whose lone tile renders folder-shaped
    //      (stat-driven: the path IS a directory on disk).
    //   3. The first tool_result's `attachments[]` gives the card real
    //      `size`/`isImage`/`mediaType` metadata to render immediately,
    //      without waiting on a live `/refs/resolve` stat round-trip.
    //
    // Only turn 1 (a fresh spawn) runs this scenario — same convention as

    // env var (`AGETOR_FAKE_CLAUDE_SENT_FILES=1`), same convention as

    // can't be scoped to one test's prompt the way a marker substring can. If
    // this branch sat ABOVE the monitor/fx-permission branches (as it

    // fake-claude turn, including ones whose prompt carries

    // and clearly wants a different canned scenario. Placing it last means
    // those more specific, prompt-marker-gated branches are checked first in

 * detection (`orchestrator.ts:detectCursorPlan`) end to end without a real
 * `cursor-agent` CLI. Chunk shapes match exactly what `mapCursorEvent`
 * produces (`cursor-tmux.ts`): the `tool_use` chunk's `data` is
 * `{id, name, input, serverSide}` with `input` = the raw `tool_call` payload
 * (so `input.createPlanToolCall.args.plan` round-trips the same way a real

 * The call_id deliberately embeds a newline — real Cursor call_ids do this
 * (plan §2) — so detection/persistence code that only exercises this path in
 * tests still gets coverage for the newline-safety requirement.
 *
 * `fakePlanCallCounter` makes the call_id unique per spawn (i.e. per turn):
 * without it, a `--resume` turn issued right after approving a plan would
 * emit the exact same call_id as the first turn, and `upsertDetectedPlan`'s
