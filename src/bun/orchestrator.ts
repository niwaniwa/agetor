 * for this task", then (b) walks a chain of awaits — `pendingTeardown`,
 * `checkHarness`, `prepareWorkdir`, `resolveRef`, `sessionLiveness`, the
 * async `spawnAgentOrFail` itself — before it has registered the new run in
 * `active` or (for codex/cursor/gemini/fx) even written `task.runId` via
 * `tasks.update`. A second overlapping call can read that same stale "idle"
 * snapshot before the first call's DB write lands, race in behind it, and
 * reach its own mint path too: two run rows, two spawned agents — or worse,
 * the second spawn's unconditional tmux pre-kill (`spawnClaudeViaTmux` et
 * al.) tearing down the first turn's session mid-spawn — for one task.
 *
 * ONE module-level set closes this window for every caller that mints a
 * fresh run without an existing one to fold into:
 *   - `startTask`'s wrapper directly below (double clicks / rapid re-POSTs
 *     to `/tasks/:id/start`);
 *   - claude's idle/dead-session mint paths (`sendClaudeTurn`'s fresh-spawn
 *     branch and `sendTurnInExistingSession`'s idle branch) — these used to
 *     share a separate `startingClaudeIdleTurns` set; unified here so a
 *     `startTask` and a claude idle-send can't each claim their own
 *     disjoint keyspace and both mint against the same task;
 *   - the four one-shot `spawn{Codex,Cursor,Gemini,Fx}TurnNow` functions,
 *     which claim at entry (before `runs.insert`) and release in `finally`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT claimed by claude's fold-while-busy path (`pasteFollowUp`,
 * inside `sendTurnInExistingSession`, above its idle branch) — folding a
 * message into an already-active run is safe under any amount of
 * concurrency by design, and serializing it here would only add latency
 * with no correctness benefit.
 *
 * Whichever call claims a taskId first proceeds through its whole function;
 * every other overlapping call for the same taskId is rejected immediately
 * with a friendly "try again" result instead of racing through the awaits
 * behind it. Trade-off, accepted: a permanently wedged tmux op (its owner
 * declined to add a timeout) leaves the claim held and that task un-startable
 * / un-sendable for the remaining lifetime of the process — strictly better
 * than the old app-wide synchronous hang this replaced, and scoped to one
 * task rather than the whole app. Revisit if/when that op grows a timeout.
 *
 * `SPAWN_RESPONSE_BUDGET_MS` (see that constant's doc) does NOT shrink the
 * window this claim closes: `startTaskInner` and `spawnResumedSession`
 * (claude's fresh-spawn path) both respond to their HTTP caller once the
 * budget elapses, before the underlying `spawnAgentOrFail` has necessarily
 * settled, but the claim itself is released by the detached continuation's
 * own `finally` once the spawn actually settles — not by the wrapper that
 * took the claim returning early. A second overlapping call during that
 * still-pending stretch keeps hitting the "already starting" guard above for
 * as long as the real spawn takes, exactly as it did before the budget was

 * keystroke-driven flow the run panel needs to reflect in near-real-time
 * (plan §3/§6), not just after the run resolves.
 *
 * - `tool_use` chunk with `name === "ExitPlanMode"` → `upsertClaudePlanFromExitPlanMode`
 *   records a `pending` plan keyed by the tool_use's `id`, superseding any
 *   prior pending claude plan.
 * - `tool_result` chunk whose `toolUseId` matches a `pending` claude plan →
 *   `resolveClaudePlan` transitions it to `approved` (capturing an edited

 *
 * Re-reads `tasks.get` rather than trusting a snapshot, same race-avoidance
 * rationale as `detectCursorPlan`: `plans` can be mutated concurrently (e.g.
 * a PATCH edit path on some other plan kind, or two chunks for the same task

 * runs on EVERY `tool_use`/`tool_result` chunk of every claude-code run —
 * assistant text/thinking chunks never reach here at all, but tool chunks
 * for ordinary tools like Read/Write/Bash are still the overwhelming
 * majority, and a large `tool_result` — a big file read, a long command's
 * output — is exactly the case where an unconditional parse is wasteful):
 *  - `tool_use`: skip unless `data` contains the literal `"name":"ExitPlanMode"`
 *    envelope substring (see `claude-tmux.ts`'s unspaced `JSON.stringify`).
 *  - `tool_result`: skip unless the task already has a `pending` claude plan
 *    — `resolveClaudePlan` only ever acts on a `tool_result` whose
 *    `toolUseId` matches an existing pending plan, so with none pending
 *    there is nothing this chunk could possibly resolve. This read is cheap

 *   persisted yet (persisting on request, not delivery, would count files
 *   that were never actually delivered).
 * - `tool_result` looks up its `toolUseId` in the stash first (the common
 *   case — same run, no restart in between). On a miss, falls back to
 *   `runs.findToolUseEvent` (a restart or reattach-replay dropped the
 *   in-memory stash) — re-parsing the original tool_use from `run_events` —
 *   but only when the result text itself looks like a delivery
 *   confirmation ({@link SENT_FILES_DELIVERED_RE}), so an ordinary

 *   coincidental "delivered to user" phrase in some other tool's output
 *   with no matching `SendUserFile` request) is a silent no-op.
 * - A delivered (non-error, {@link parseSentFilesToolResult}'s content-aware
 *   `delivered` check) result persists one {@link SentFileEntry} per
 *   ENTRY IN `res.attachments` when that array is non-empty — claude's own
 *   structured, authoritative record of what actually went out — and falls
 *   back to one entry per `req.files` path only when `res.attachments` is
 *   empty (an unrecognized-but-attachment-less success shape). This means a
 *   request for N files whose attachments only confirm M < N of them
 *   persists M entries, not N — attachments are the ground truth for "what
 *   was delivered", the request is only "what was asked for". Persistence
 *   goes through `tasks.mergeSentFiles` (dedupes by path — a replayed pair,
 *   or the same file delivered twice, is idempotent) and fires the
 *   live-only `files-sent` `GlobalEvent` with `count = entries.length`
 *   (reflecting whichever source produced the entries). A non-delivered
 *   result (`is_error`, or a non-error result that still didn't deliver —
 *   e.g. a declined/interrupted call, see `sent-files.ts`) persists nothing
 *   and fires nothing — it shouldn't inflate the badge.
 *
 * Relative paths (in `res.attachments` paths, or in `req.files` on the
 * fallback) resolve against the run's cwd (`task.worktreePath ??
 * task.workdir` — the same precedence `/open-path` uses); an already-
 * absolute path passes through unchanged. When sourced from attachments,
 * `size`/`mediaType`/`isImage` come straight off that attachment; on the
 * `req.files` fallback (no attachments at all) they're `null`.
 *
 * Gated on `eventId !== null` at the very top: `null` means
 * `runs.appendEvent`'s dedup path found the row already persisted (a
 * reattach replay re-delivering a line this process already streamed
 * before a restart) — that pair was already handled the first time
 * through, so re-running detection here would be redundant work at best
 * and, for the `tool_use` stash, would re-add an entry nothing will ever
 * consume (its `tool_result` was already deduped away too, on the same
 * replay). Never throws — the caller wraps this in try/catch, same
 * "detection bugs must never break run settlement" contract as
 * `maybeUpdateTodoProgress`/`maybeTrackClaudePlan` above.

 * by the task's current model (`supportedEfforts`, discovered-then-curated,

 * checked both by raw id AND via `toClaudeModelArg` so an alias (e.g. claude

 * stored id against an already-equivalent one. A `null` `task.model` (the

 * on claude's/agetor's default) is compared as if it already held
 * `DEFAULT_MODEL["claude-code"]`: a bare `/model` immediately followed by Esc
 * reports `Kept model as <the default's display name>`, which resolves to
 * that same default id — without this, the row would get pinned to an
 * explicit id it never asked for, just because the user opened and closed
 * the picker without changing anything.
 *
 * A `Kept model as <X>` outcome (`ClaudeLocalModelOutcome.kept`) that DOES
 * differ from the row is additionally gated on `info.viaMirror`: it only
 * writes the row when agetor's own `mirrorModelViaPicker` provoked the
 * `Switch model?` the user then declined. A user's own bare `/model` + Esc
 * reports the same line but must NOT overwrite a next-run model the user
 * deliberately chose in the dropdown (typically one the installed picker
 * can't select at all) — that case emits a breadcrumb naming both values and
 * returns false. See `SessionState.lastModelMirrorAt` in claude-tmux.ts for
 * how the attribution is established, and `ClaudeLocalModelOutcome` for why
 * the parse can't make this call itself.
 *
 * A model sync that lands on a model which no longer supports the task's
 * saved effort adjusts the effort in the SAME `tasks.update` — mirroring
 * `effortFallbackForModelChange` above (itself a mirror of the RunPanel's
 * own effect) — rather than leaving a row with an impossible (model,
 * effort) pair until the next unrelated PATCH happens to fix it. This
 * cascaded effort adjustment is, like every other write this function makes,
 * NEVER mirrored into the live session via `sendSlashCommand` — claude's own
 * live model/effort pair is left exactly as claude set it; the row-side
 * adjustment only governs what the model dropdown shows and what the NEXT
 * spawn (or the next explicit `/effort` from the dropdown) will use. The
 * breadcrumb says so explicitly ("for the next run") so the user doesn't
 * read it as "agetor just changed your live effort".

 * Forward a line of user-supplied input to the agent. Behavior depends on
 * agent kind:
 *
 *   • claude-code: when the session is idle, each user message is its own
 *     turn → its own run row (paste into the live tmux session + a new turn
 *     slot via `sendTurn`). When a turn is already in flight, the message is
 *     *folded* into the active run instead (`pasteFollowUp` — paste into the
 *     session, record a user event on the current run, no new row/slot). This
 *     keeps at most one in-flight run per task so claude coalescing queued
 *     messages can't strand surplus run rows in `running`. See
 *     `sendTurnInExistingSession`.
 *
 *   • codex: each follow-up is queued and spawned as its own `codex exec
 *     resume <thread_id>` turn once the active turn resolves — codex `exec`
 *     is a one-shot process, not a REPL, so there's no live stdin to write
 *     to mid-turn. See `sendCodexTurn`/`drainCodexQueue`.
 *
 *   • cursor: same queue-and-resume shape as codex (`sendCursorTurn`/
 *     `drainCursorQueue`), spawning a fresh `cursor-agent --resume
 *     <session-id>` turn for each queued follow-up — cursor's CLI is
 *     one-shot per turn too.
 *
 *   • gemini: same queue-and-resume shape as codex (`sendGeminiTurn`/
 *     `drainGeminiQueue`), spawning `gemini --resume <session-id>` for each
 *     queued follow-up — gemini's CLI is one-shot per turn too.
 *
 *   • fx: same queue-and-resume shape as codex/cursor/gemini (`sendFxTurn`/
 *     `drainFxQueue`), resuming via fx's ACP session id for each queued
 *     follow-up — fx has no persistent REPL either (see fx-acp.ts).
 *
 * Archived / detached-worktree restore: a message to an archived task
 * auto-unarchives it (sending is an unambiguous signal of continued
 * interest), and if the task's worktree was detached (by archive) or is
 * otherwise missing on disk, it's rematerialized via `prepareWorkdir` before
 * dispatch — same deterministic path, branch, and history, so the resumed
 * turn lands in the same place the agent left off. A hard restore failure
 * (e.g. the branch was deleted or checked out elsewhere) is surfaced as a
 * `delivered: false` result rather than silently falling back to an
 * unisolated cwd.
 *
 * Bounded wait: claude's dead/no-session mint path (idle send with no live
 * tmux session — `sendClaudeTurn` → `spawnResumedSession`) never holds this
 * promise open past `SPAWN_RESPONSE_BUDGET_MS` waiting for the underlying
 * `claude --resume` spawn, which has taken 5-30s in practice (see that
 * constant's doc). When the spawn hasn't settled by then, this resolves
 * `{ delivered: true, runId, pending: true }` — the run row, column flip and
 * `user` event are already persisted, which is what the caller needs to
 * render — and the spawn keeps running detached. Every other path (folding
 * into an active run, and codex/cursor/gemini/fx's queue-and-resume) is
 * unaffected and never sets `pending`.

 * "paused"`, `requiredAction === "continue_later"`). Resuming replays that
 * checkpoint via a fresh `session/resume` + `session/prompt {..,
 * _meta:{fx:{continueRecovery:true}}}` turn (see `spawnFxRun`'s
 * `continueRecovery` variant and fx-acp.ts) — no new prompt is sent, so the
 * user's next real message still lands on the same conversation.
 *
 * Called from two places: a manual resume (`opts.origin` omitted or
 * `"manual"` — the `/tasks/:id/fx-resume` route, `agetor resume`, the
 * webview's Resume button) and the auto-resume engine's own timer
 * (`fireFxAutoResume`, `opts.origin: "auto"` with `attempt`/`max` naming
 * which attempt this is — plan `docs/plans/fx-recovery-follow-ups.md` §3 T2
 * item 6). The two differ only in: a manual resume additionally cancels any
 * pending auto-resume timer up front (the user acting IS an implicit
 * cancel — a scheduled auto-resume must not also fire later and double-spawn
 * a turn against the checkpoint this manual resume is about to consume) with
 * no status line of its own (`spawnFxRun`'s own row lifecycle for the
 * `continueRecovery` branch already leaves the row in the right shape); and
 * the opening status line `spawnFxRun` writes differs (see `FxTurn`'s doc).
 *
 * Claims the module-level `resumingTaskIds` set synchronously, before any
 * `await` — this is what used to be the `/fx-resume` route's own
 * `fxResumesInFlight` claim, moved here so the auto-resume timer and every
 * HTTP caller share ONE guard against a double-resume race (two POSTs, or a
 * POST racing the timer, landing on the same task). Released in `finally`.
 *
 * Every OTHER gating check below runs BEFORE `spawnFxRun` is ever called,
 * because an ungated call would spawn a real run row (flipping the card to
 * `running`, opening a live fx ACP process) only to have fx's own
 * `session/prompt` answer `-32602 "No paused model response to continue"` —
 * a run failing for a reason agetor could have caught synchronously against
 * data it already has. Order matters: existence and archival first (cheap,
 * no DB scan), then the harness-kind check (a non-fx task can never have a
 * recovery sentinel, but checking first gives a clearer error than "no
 * paused response"), then in-flight (nothing to gate against once a turn is
 * already running), then the run/sentinel/session-id lookups that actually
 * decide resumability (`latestResumableFxPause`, extracted from what used to
 * be this function's own inline lookup — see that function's doc).
 *
 * `spawnFxRun` can still fail AFTER all of the above passes (missing
 * harness — effectively unreachable here since the `kind !== "fx"` check
 * just above resolves the identical harness synchronously, with no `await`
 * in between for it to vanish; or `spawnAgentOrFail` throwing, e.g. a
 * transient spawn error) — Phase 8 review #10: that failure used to be
 * invisible, because `spawnFxRun` returned the SAME truthy `runId` a real
 * spawn does even on those branches, so this function reported `{ ok: true,
 * runId }` for a resume that never started. The caller (`POST
 * /tasks/:id/fx-resume`, `agetor resume`, the webview's Resume button,
 * `fireFxAutoResume`) has no way to see the run row's own `failed` status the
 * way a live run panel does, so a `spawned: false` result is now surfaced as
 * a real HTTP failure (500 — the request was well-formed and passed every
 * gate, but the server genuinely couldn't start the turn) rather than a
 * false 200. The run row `spawnFxRun` already wrote (status `failed`, with
 * the failure reason on its `stderr`/status chunks) is kept as-is — it's the
 * durable record of the failed resume attempt, not rolled back or deleted

/**
 * Shared `onPasteFailure` hook for BOTH claude paste paths in
 * `sendTurnInExistingSession` above — the fold-while-busy follow-up (via
 * `pasteFollowUp`) and a fresh idle turn (via `sendTurn`): a blocking claude
 * modal (T7's paste guard, docs/plans/model-effort-local-command-turns.md
 * §10) was still on the pane when the queued paste's grace window elapsed,
 * so `text` was never actually delivered to the live session as intended.
 * The optimistic "user" bubble the caller already appended stays in the
 * transcript (matching every other optimistic-paste case), but `text` itself
 * would otherwise be lost. `outcome.op`/`outcome.phase` say WHERE the
 * withhold happened:
 *
 *   - `outcome.op !== "modal-guard"` (finding #5, §10 re-review): a REAL
 *     tmux subprocess failure — `load-buffer`/`paste-buffer`/`send-keys`
 *     exited non-zero (dead server, socket gone, session vanished mid-op) —
 *     forwarded verbatim by `sendTurn`/`pasteFollowUp` with no `phase` at
 *     all (only the driver's own synthesized `"modal-guard"` outcomes carry
 *     one). Falling through to the phase-based branches below used to
 *     mislabel this as "claude is waiting on a prompt", which it isn't. The
 *     driver's `reportPasteFailure` already emitted a `"paste failed: tmux
 *     <op> — …"` status chunk on this run before calling `onPasteFailure`,
 *     so this branch does NOT repeat that wording — it re-stashes `text`
 *     and adds a separate, backlog-focused status.
 *   - `"pre-enter"`: the bracketed paste itself landed — `text` is already
 *     sitting in claude's input box, just missing its trailing Enter. Also
 *     re-stashed (finding #3, §10 re-review): the driver's composer-clear
 *     flow now actively CLEARS this leftover text with `Escape Escape`
 *     before the session's next paste (finding #2, §10 re-review), so
 *     leaving it un-stashed here would mean it's silently wiped with no
 *     record once that clear runs. `restashPasteWithheldText`'s dedupe
 *     (a scan of the WHOLE backlog, not just its most-recent item — finding
 *     #3, §10 re-review) still prevents pile-up across repeated pre-enter
 *     withholds of the same message.
 *   - `"composer-dirty"`: an EARLIER withheld message is still sitting in
 *     claude's input box (mid-turn there's no safe way to clear it), so this
 *     NEW paste was withheld before ever reaching the pane. Re-stashed like
 *     `"pre-paste"`, with its own status wording naming the earlier message.
 *   - `"pre-paste"` (or a missing `phase` on an otherwise-`"modal-guard"`
 *     outcome, which shouldn't happen in practice): nothing reached the pane
 *     at all — re-stash `text` into the task's backlog tray so it isn't
 *     lost outright.
 *
 * Re-stashing dedupes against every existing backlog item (not just the
 * most-recently-added one at `task.backlog[0]` — items are unshifted onto
 * the front, see `backlog.add` in db.ts), so a paste that keeps failing
 * across retries with the same text doesn't pile up duplicate drafts, AND so
 * resending a withheld message straight from the tray (`sendBacklogItem` in
 * RunPanel.tsx) doesn't leave a duplicate sitting behind the original
 * (finding #3, §10 re-review) — that item is very often NOT at index 0 by
 * the time its resend is withheld again, since other drafts may have been
 * added or reordered since.
 *
 * `backlog.add` is called directly rather than through the server's
 * `backlogGuard` (an HTTP-route-level check, not something this internal
 * plumbing goes through) — that's safe ONLY because every caller of this
 * function is reachable exclusively through `sendInput`, which auto-
 * unarchives the task before dispatching a turn. This function still
 * re-checks `tasks.get(taskId)?.archivedAt == null` immediately before
 * adding, in case a concurrent `archiveTask` raced the unarchive between
 * `sendInput`'s check and this callback (`onPasteFailure` fires
 * synchronously inside the tmux call chain, not on the same tick as
 * `sendInput`'s own unarchive) — skip + log rather than resurrect an
 * archived task's backlog out from under an in-flight archive.
 *
 * `text` is already the fully-composed message (references, if any, are
 * flattened into it client-side before it ever reaches `sendInput` — see
 * the `/runs/:id/input` route), so there's nothing further to pass through —
 * except that both call sites in `sendTurnInExistingSession` deliberately
 * pass the PRE-expansion (`rawLine ?? line`) text, not the `@token`-expanded
 * one `sendInput` actually hands to claude (R2, code review): a draft/tray
 * backlog item is saved with the raw `@token` form, and this function's own
 * dedupe (`restashPasteWithheldText`'s `item.text === text` scan) would never
 * match an expanded absolute-path re-stash against it, producing a duplicate
 * entry every time the same withheld message is retried.

 * gemini are never candidates: their sessions are one-shot per turn and
 * self-dispose (`codex-tmux.ts`, `gemini-tmux.ts`), so there's nothing to
 * reap.
 *
 * Two performance properties keep a sweep from becoming a synchronous burst
 * that stalls the main process for the duration of the scan (previously: N
 * non-archived claude tasks × ~5 DB queries + a blocking tmux probe each, all
 * in one event-loop turn):
 *  - **Cheap pre-filter.** `candidateIds` is derived entirely from the rows
 *    `tasks.list()` already fetched (no per-candidate `tasks.get` yet) and
 *    excludes any task that plainly can't own a session: archived, non-claude,
 *    or — the key trim — neither holding in-memory `SessionState` nor ever
 *    having started a run (`hasSessionState(t.id) || t.runId != null`). A
 *    never-started task fails both and drops out before it costs anything
 *    more than an array filter.
 *  - **Per-candidate yield.** `await Bun.sleep(0)` at the top of every loop
 *    iteration hands control back to the event loop between candidates, so
 *    HTTP requests, SSE pushes, and session tailers keep running throughout a
 *    sweep instead of queuing up behind it. This is what makes the pre-kill
 *    re-check below load-bearing rather than defensive-only: with real
 *    yields between iterations, a message that lands mid-sweep (starts a
 *    turn, opens a pending interaction) MUST be caught by a guard re-read
 *    immediately before the kill, not just the one the loop started with.
 *
 * Every guard is re-checked against a freshly-read task row immediately
 * before the kill, not from the snapshot the loop started with. Guard work
 * itself is hoisted to avoid redundant reads: `isReapable` takes the already
 * -fetched `Task` row and calls the pure `isTaskHeldByBackgroundAgents(task)`
 * predicate directly rather than the taskId-keyed `isHeldByBackgroundAgents`
 * wrapper, which would otherwise re-fetch the same row internally.
 *
 * Called once ~30s after boot (letting boot reattach settle first) and then
 * on a `SESSION_REAP_SWEEP_MS` interval from `src/bun/index.ts` and
 * `src/bun/headless.ts`.
