 * ("Full access"; see `AGENT_OPTIONS.fx.modes` and the `CODE_PLAN_MODE.fx`
 * comment). Used by every spawn branch in `src/bun/agents.ts`'s
 * `buildCommand`/`spawnAgent`, by `reconcileTaskSession`, by `agetor add`'s
 * non-interactive default, and by the webview's mode dropdown fallback for a
 * `null` row (RunPanel's `nullModeFallback`) and its reset on switching a
 * task's agent kind. `createTask` still stores `null` for an unset mode —
 * only resolution at spawn/display time changed — so this function, not a
 * stored value, is the one place "what does null mean" can drift.
 *
 * This supersedes the earlier "a stored null still spawns as auto (even for
 * fx)" rule: the owner explicitly asked for fx's hands-off default to
 * escalate to Full access (`docs/plans/fx-recovery-follow-ups.md` §3.6),
 * since fx's `auto` mode blocks on an interactive permission card whenever
 * its hard-wired reviewer is unreachable (see the fx harness section of
 * CLAUDE.md) — `auto` is not actually hands-off for fx the way it is for
 * every other kind.

 * into the New PR composer's Title field and the description into its
 * Description field without a second turn. Two blocks (not one) because the
 * composer has two separate fields; the copy button grabs a whole fenced block.
 *
 * The description block uses a FOUR-backtick fence on purpose: PR descriptions
 * routinely contain their own ``` code fences (test output, snippets), and a
 * 3-backtick outer fence is closed early by the first inner ```, truncating the
 * copied text. A 4-backtick fence is closed only by >=4 backticks, so inner ```
 * blocks survive verbatim (verified against micromark, react-markdown's parser:
 * 4-tick outer -> one <pre>; 3-tick outer -> two, split at the inner fence).
